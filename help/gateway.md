# Apps

All apps are listed in the Gateway. To open an app, open the Gateway and find the app that you want to open. Alternatively, use the Box to search for the app you wish to open.

# Box

The Box searches your PC, runs a command, does a task or opens a webpage depending on what you type. Try these:
- To open theMedia, type in "theMedia" and find theMedia in the list. Click on theMedia, or use the arrow keys and the ENTER key to navigate the app list.
- To run the command pavucontrol, simply type in "pavucontrol" into the box and hit ENTER. You can also pass arguments to the command by typing them in.

You don't even need to click on the box to use it. Simply hit the SUPER key or open the Gateway and enter your command.
